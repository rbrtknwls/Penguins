My attempt at making a really short game / animation!

The plan is to use absolutly zero external libraries and do everything with javascript and promises. Theres definitely a super cheesy line I could come up with based on that, but im not that bad (unless..?). Anyways even though animating using javascript canvas's isnt super optimial I shall try my best to make sure it runs at > 2fps.

Currently I am planning to do have the following scenes which mimic like places and dates we went on:
  1) Skating at Nathan Phillip Square (Talking about the lights on the far buildings and what they remind us of).
  2) Going for a long walk, reaching a river and eating nutella pancakes (yeah im a bit of a chef)
  3) Playing stardew valley with each other even though I was in DC and shes in TO.
